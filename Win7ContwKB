I need help with how to build controls for all ARDrone flight, video capture, navigation and fight sensors, 
incorporating a list of autopilot flight paths as well as some AI code, such as letting the Drone decide the best 
auto flight path to select from, based on data such as proximity sensor triggers, wind speed, weather condition, 
charge remaining on battery, recent self diagnostic/performance scan, and or changes it detects when comparing 
current video sample to saved snapshot of same location. I am currently trying to use Windows 7 and XP PC,s with 
KB and mouse input for manual flight control input and updating software on-board the drone. Also can decisions be 
based on some other function, ability or sensor resource on-board the ARDrone that I am not aware of ? If someone 
can help with basic code building instructions to control flight with Windows 7 using KB and mouse it would 
greatly appreciated , Thank You.
